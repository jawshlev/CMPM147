				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Clothing and particularly outfit combinations are something that I am personally passionate about so I thought to incorporate this passion into this assignment. Often on social media I see many, posts about potential outfits, featuring pieces of clothing on a blank background.
				These are outfits are often given titles like, cute cafe outfit, or something trendy like "grunge cybery2k". I wanted to take my own spin on it and generate outfits with the added bonus of locations, the locations themselves don't specificially line up to what the outfit could entail
				and neither do any of the pieces of attire in relation to each other, that is just a fun aspect to this project.
